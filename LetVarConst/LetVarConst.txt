Variable declare with let and const will be stored in a different memory space than the global
so if we will try to access these variable before initialization it will give the reference error 'Cannot
access the variable before initialization'

Difference b/w these three

1.) let and const has a separate memory rather than the global space
var is related to the global space
2.) let is strict than var means we can redeclare the variable with var keyword but not in the case of 
let
e.g. 
var b = 100;
var b = 1000;
//this will not give any error
let a= 10;
let a = 10;
//this will get an error --> Syntax error 'Identifier a has already been declared
3.) let and const 
Const is more strict than let, hence you can't initialize the value later you must initialize the value 
at the same at the time of declaration otherwise you'll get the Syntax error -> Missing initializer
e.g. (i)
const b;
b=1000;
e.g.(ii)
const b = 100;
b = 1000 //syntax error cannot redeclare


best one is const then let then var
