What is a Unit Test?
===================

A unit test verifies the behavior of a software unit in the system. It verifies whether a small and isolated piece of the codebase called “unit” behaves as the developer intended.

=> Unit test verifies the smallest parts or components by comparing the actual behaviour with the expected behaviour in the complete isolation.
=> here complete isolation means that, during the unit testing, devs do not connect the application with external dependencies such as database, the file system or HTTP services.
=> This allows unit tests to be fast and stable since they won't fail due to problems integrating with those
external services.

Why write Unit Tests?
