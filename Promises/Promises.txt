What is a Promise?

Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript

The promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

Importance of promise:-
1.) To prevent callback hell
2.) prevent inversion of control
3.) generate trust.

There are two things we have with the promise object one is promise state and second is promise result.
Initialy the promise is in pending state when API takes its time and completes the operation, then the promise state gets changed to fulfilled.

Before promise we call the APIs like this

createOrder(cart, function(orderId){
    proceedToPayment(orderId, function(){
        showOrderSummary(paymentInfo, function(){
            updateWalletBalance()
        })
    });
})

after promises we use the promise chaining

 createOrder(cart)
 .then(function(orderId){
    return proceedToPayment(orderId)
  })
  .then(function(paymentInfo){
    return showOrderSummary(paymentInfo);
  })
  .then(function(paymentInfo){
    return updateWalletBalance(paymentInfo)
   })

Now we will see how to create a promise

to create a promise we have to use a Promise Constructor

new Promise(function(resolve, reject)){

}
//the resolve and reject are the functions that are provided by the javascript

for error handling we use the catch block attaching with promise chain.

//Async/Await
