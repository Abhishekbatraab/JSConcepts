Difference between these three
================================
Call => We have a call method which is used to invoke a function directly by passing in the reference
        point to the the 'name' object.
Apply => Apply is same as the 'Call' method the only Difference is it takes the second argument as an array 
         list. 
Bind => Bind method doesn't directly invokes the method but gives you the copy of exactly same method  
        which can be invoke later
