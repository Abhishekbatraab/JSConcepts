What is the spread operator in JavaScript?

->The spread operator is a new addition to the set of operators in JavaScript ES6. 
->It takes in an iterable (e.g an array) and expands it into individual elements.
->The spread operator is commonly used to make deep copies of JS objects.when we have nested arrays or 
nested data in an object, the spread operator makes a deep copy of top-level data and shallow copy of 
the nested data. 
->Using this operator makes the code consice and readable.

Syntax:-

let array = ['h', 'e', 'y'];
...array = 'h', 'e', 'y'

Examples: Since the array data structure is widely used, it will be considered in all the subsequent examples.

The array2 has the elements of array1 copied into it. Any changes made to array1 will not be reflected in array2 and vice versa.

If the simple assignment operator had been used then array2 would have been assigned a reference to array1 and the changes made in one array would reflect in the other array which in most cases is undesirable.
