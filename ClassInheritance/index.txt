Class Inheritance
===================

Inheritance enables you to define a class that takes all the functionality from a parent class and allows you to add more.

Using class inheritance, a class can inherit all the methods and properties of another class.

Inheritance is a useful feature that allows code reusability.

To use class inheritance, you use the extends keyword.

JavaScript super() keyword
==========================

The super keyword used inside a child class denotes its parent class.

Overriding Method or Property
================================
If a child class has the same method or property name as that of parent class, it will use the method  and property of child class. This concept is called Method Overriding.

Uses of Inheritance
Since a child class can inherit all the functionalities of the parent's class, this allows code reusability.
Once a functionality is developed, you can simply inherit it. No need to reinvent the wheel. This allows for cleaner code and easier to maintain.
Since you can also add your own functionalities in the child class, you can inherit only the useful functionalities and define other required features.
